        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I had avoided making lasagna up until now because all those layers just looked like hard work to me.

            Having finally relented I discovered that it’s about as simple to make as spag bol, with just one extra (easy) step in making the cheesy bechamel sauce! The mind can play tricks on you it can : )
            
            I made the traditional lasagna healthier simply by reducing the amount of meat and increasing the amount of vegetables. I also cooked it in some homemade chicken stock.
            
            Simply by doing these two things, I’ve increased the vitamin, mineral, phytonutrient and fibre content of the dish.  Also, cooking the meat in the chicken stock makes it more digestible, not to mention boosts the immune system and delivers all that gorgeous gelatin, collagen and glycine to the body.
            
            Lasagna will be definitely making a regular appearance on my meal plans.</p>
